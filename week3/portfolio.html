				<p>ALICIA AND PETE</p>
				<p>I had the pleasure of designing wedding invitations for my friends Pete and Alicia. They wanted a mo-town feel for their invites and of course I loved that they wanted to incorporate music. I came up with a custom lettered monogram based on the motown label logos from the 50's that I became inspired by. I also expanded the lettering into their names and also onto the RSVP card.</p>

				<h>DEUX CORNICHONS BREWING COLLABORATIVE</h> 
				<p>Deux Cornichons first began when two of my closest friends were getting married (in which one is quickly becoming a master brewer) created wedding beers for favors. They called themselves Deux Cornichons. It then quickly became a collaborative when myself and three other friends joined. With the love of beer, art, friends, woodworking, and the internets, we became a brewing collaborative, brewing our own beer, creating custom artwork, building taps and kegerators and spreading a little love.</p>

				<h>HAYLEY REARDON</h>
				<p>Hayley is only 15 years old and is an amazing singer and songwriter. She had a clear vision about her album Where the Artists Go and it was such a pleasure working with her on it. The CD is a digipak with a pocket that holds a 20 page booklet! Hayley wanted the booklet to be a artists journal that would hold all of her songs and lyrics in it. I was blown away with her vision and how she wanted to give her fans a wonderful package to go along with her wonderful music. Check her out!</p>

				<h>BARBARA KESSLER</h>
				<p>Barbara is a great singer/songwriter that needed a CD design for her new album, What You Keep.
				She wanted a digipak design with a pocket. The pocket was actually kept empty so her fans can have a place for the things they want to keep. Such a great idea and especially how it ties into the album name! The actual disc was printed on the silver of the disc as seen on gray here. 
				Collage art designed by Sue Pelletier.</p>

				<h>ADVANSTAR/IVT NETWORK</h>
				<p>While working at Advanstar I had an assignment to create a cover for an product e-book. IVT network provides articles, videos, infographics, compendiums and quizzes for several pharma/biotech topics. It would become a toolkit that contained everything you need to know about a certain topic. Working with the marketing department we came up with a literal toolkit concept and within the box I illustrated the "tools" you would find within the book. </p>

				<h>INSTANT BAND SITE</h>
				<p>While working at Nimbit, the company created a free Wordpress plugin called, Instant Band Siteâ„¢, to help an artist or band create and maintain a music website. They wanted to create a site for it and needed a logo for the plugin as well as a banner for the home page and other widgets advertising the plug in. I also began working on UI frames for the product.</p>
