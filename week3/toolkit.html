				<h>ADVANSTAR/IVT NETWORK</h>
				<p>While working at Advanstar I had an assignment to create a cover for an product e-book. IVT network provides articles, videos, infographics, compendiums and quizzes for several pharma/biotech topics. It would become a toolkit that contained everything you need to know about a certain topic. Working with the marketing department we came up with a literal toolkit concept and within the box I illustrated the "tools" you would find within the book. </p>
